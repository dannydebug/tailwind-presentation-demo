# TailwindCSS

## **Introduction**

Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework for building user interfaces. It takes a functional approach to web design by providing thousands of tiny classes to use directly in your HTML.


While frameworks like Bootstrap take an approach of creating styles for high level components (buttons, forms, etc.), Tailwind takes a more flexible approach with its utility classes that can be applied together to build components.

It can be used standalone or as a PostCSS plugin.

It scans your code and generates only the CSS classes that you are actually using.

## **Customization**

Tailwind provides a solid but flexible structure for theming, to provide your own look and feel and apply it through the same utility classes.
