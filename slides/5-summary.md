# **Summary**

> Tailwind acts more as an API for your design system than a CSS framework.

## Some of the many advantages

- It helps you with being consistent with color choices, spaces, typography, etc.
- You work in a more constrained system -- in a good way.
- No need to invent many class names.
- With utility classes everything is reusable.
- Make changes without worrying what else you're breaking, as classes in your HTML are local.
